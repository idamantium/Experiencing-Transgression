How can the feeling of infiltration, be it through bodily trespassing, mediated projection, or retrieval of taboo knowledge, create radical possibilities? Ida will draw on her history of creating experiences in place you arenâ€™t supposed to be to ground your code poetry experiments in the affective and interpersonal.

## Day 1 (7pm - 9pm)

- Erving Goffman's System

Getting in & Getting Away With It

## Day 2 (7pm - 9pm, preceded by office hours at 6)

If you're working on something already, interrogate the experience of it based on the principals we went over. Make it worth experiencing rather than just knowing about. Or add an element of infiltration/transgression to jack up the experience.

If you don't have a code poetry baby you're nurturing yet, pick something to infiltrate and design an experience for it. You're encouraged to focus on the experience of infiltration as the transformative potential.
