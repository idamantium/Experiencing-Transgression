# Experiencing-Transgression
SFPC class for Summer 2016 Code Subversion course
http://sfpc.io/summer16short/

How can the feeling of infiltration, be it through bodily trespassing, mediated projection, or retrieval of taboo knowledge, create radical possibilities? Ida will draw on her history of creating experiences in place you arenâ€™t supposed to be to ground your code poetry experiments in the affective and interpersonal.

## Day 1 (7pm - 9pm)

Designing for Experience
- Erving Goffman's System
- Handy Things from Game Design

Getting in & Getting Away With It
- Cacophony Society Principals
- Passing and Identity


## Day 2 (7pm - 9pm, preceeded by office hours at 6)

If you're working on something already, interrigate the experience of it based on the pricipals we went over. Make it worth expereincing rather than just knowing about. Or add an element of infiltration/transgression to jack up the experience. 

If you don't have a code poetry baby you're nurturing yet, pick something to infiltrate and design an experience for it. You're encouraged to focus on the experience of inflitration as the transforamtive potential.
